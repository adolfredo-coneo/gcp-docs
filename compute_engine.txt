//Bootstraping
The process of installing and configuring a server with any software, or installing OS patches when the VM instance is launched is called bootstrapping.

//Hardening an image
The process of securing an image by removing unnecessary software, locking down the OS, and installing security patches is called hardening.

//There are two types of discount in GCP vm instances
1. Sustained use discount
2. Committed use discount

//SPot VMs
Spot VMs are preemptible VMs that can be terminated at any time. They are ideal for workloads that can be interrupted, such as batch jobs, data processing, and rendering.

//Sole tenant nodes
Sole tenant nodes are VMs that run on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer. They are ideal for workloads that require high levels of isolation, such as financial services, healthcare, and government.

//instance groups
Instance groups are a collection of VMs that are managed as a single entity. They are ideal for workloads that require high availability, such as web servers and batch jobs.
- Managed instance groups
    * Features: Auto scaling, auto healing, rolling updates, and load balancing
- Unmanaged instance groups
    * Features: None
    * Not recommended unless you need different kinds of VMs

//Managed instance groups
Managed instance groups are a collection of VMs that are managed as a single entity. They are ideal for workloads that require high availability, such as web servers and batch jobs.
- Maintains a specified number of VMs
- Detect application failures and restarts VMs
- Provides auto scaling
- Add load balancing to a managed instance group
- Create instances in multiple zones
- Release new versions of your application with zero downtime

//GCP Cloud Load Balancing
GCP Cloud Load Balancing is a global load balancing service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple VMs. It is ideal for workloads that require high availability,
such as web servers and batch jobs.
Managed service
- Load balancing across multiple zones
- Load balancing across multiple regions
- GC ensures that the load balancer is highly available
- Auto scales to handle huge loads
- Load balancers can be public or private
Types:
- HTTP(S) Load Balancing
- TCP Proxy Load Balancing
- SSL Proxy Load Balancing
- Network Load Balancing
- Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing
