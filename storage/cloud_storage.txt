//Cloud Storage
- Most popular, very flexible & inexpensive storage service
    * Serverless: Autoscaling and infinite scale

- Store large objects using a key-value approach:
    * Treats entire objects as a unit (Partial updates not allowed)
    * Objects are stored in buckets
    * Access control at object level

- Also called object storage

- Provides a RESTful API to access and modify objects
    * Also provides CLI (gsutil) and client libraries

- Store all file types
